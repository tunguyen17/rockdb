Astrophyllite,A member of the Astrophyllite Supergroup

Amphibole,An extensive and complex group of minerals presently divided into a group/subgroup/root-name hierarchy (see group/subgroup/root-name files for the individual species). The amphibole group remains under study with the most recent, IMA-approved nomenclature being published in 2012 (Hawthorne et al., 2012, superseding Hawthorne & Oberti, 2006
w(O)-dominant Amphibole Group,The W(O)-dominant Amphibole Group belongs to the amphibole supergroup and contains the amphibole minerals with WO2- > W((OH)+F+Cl)2-.
Obertiite,The obertiite root name is for Prof. Roberta Oberti, University of Pavia, Italy, for her contributions to the crystal chemistry of amphiboles.
Eudialyte,A complex group of trigonal cyclosilicates with both three-fold (Si3O9)6- and nine-fold (Si9O27)18-rings. In some members, two nine-fold rings are bridged by a single silicon atom to give a [(Si9O27)2SiO]34-group.
Devilline,A group of crystal that have the color blue
