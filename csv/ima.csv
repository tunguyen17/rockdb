IMA Status,description
Approved,The mineral species has been formally accepted by the IMA as a valid species and published in a peer-reviewed journal.
Not Approved,The mineral species has not been accepted by the IMA as a valid species.
Valid Species,"The mineral species is considered valid but was published before 1959, the date the IMA started to approve mineral species. The minerals classified as such (e.g., gold, galena, etc.) would probably rate IMA approval (but not always) if submitted today. All minerals considered valid prior to 1959 were grandfathered as such."
Discredited,Mineral species that are currently considered valid but were formally discredited
Proposed,Unnamed mineral species known only by the year and vote number (eg. IMA2001-043). The species is unnamed until formal publication of the mineral species data in a peer-reviewed journal. Occasionally, the mineral name is not kept secret prior to publication and leaks out. Hubite is a recent example of a new species name known before publication and even before the IMA vote. Proposed minerals are given a tentative Dana classification number which is subject to change once the mineral is published.
Redefinition,The mineral is reconsidered for redefinition
Reconsideration,The discredited mineral species is being examined and tested for reconsideration.
Pre-approval,The mineral species is approved on the preliminary exam. Further work is still needed.
Pending Approval,The mineral species is being worked on.
Unkown,The IMA status is unknown
